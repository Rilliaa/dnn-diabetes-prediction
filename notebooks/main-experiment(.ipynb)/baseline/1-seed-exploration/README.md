# 🌱 Seed Exploration with Suggested Neural Network Architecture

This project focuses on seed data exploration using a structured deep neural network (DNN) architecture, as illustrated in the `suggested_dnn-arch_pattern.png` diagram.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model adopts a multi-layer feedforward neural network with the following neuron configuration:

- **Input Layer**: 21 neurons  
- **Hidden Layer 1**: 64 neurons  
- **Hidden Layer 2**: 32 neurons  
- **Hidden Layer 3**: 16 neurons  
- **Output Layer**: 3 neurons

This architecture is designed to capture complex patterns in the dataset while maintaining a balance between depth and computational efficiency. The structure is based on a recommended configuration optimized for classification tasks within seed-related data domains.

## 📊 Objective

The primary objective is to explore and analyze seed characteristics using deep learning methods, leveraging this tailored architecture for improved pattern recognition and classification performance.

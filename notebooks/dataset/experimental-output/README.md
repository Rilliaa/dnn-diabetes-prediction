## Experimental datasets from optimized preprocessing techniques, prepared for DNN model training

This folder contains the processed datasets resulting from the experimental combinations of optimization techniques applied in this study. These datasets serve as input for training various versions of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model.

### The datasets are organized into three categories:
- **Autoencoders**: Datasets with reduced dimensionality using autoencoders.
- **SMOTE**: Datasets with balanced class distribution using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).
- **KCC + Autoencoders**: Datasets processed with feature selection using Kendall’s Correlation Coefficient (KCC) followed by dimensionality reduction using autoencoders.

Each subfolder represents a specific experiment path and supports the training and evaluation of a distinct model variant.
